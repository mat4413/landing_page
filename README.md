# Landing Page Project  

This project is a **landing page design** applying all the knowledge acquired so far in **The Odin Project**.  

## What I Learned  
This landing page implements fundamental **HTML** and **CSS** concepts, including:  
- Basic **HTML structure**  
- **Images**, **links**, and **lists** in HTML  
- Applying styles with **CSS**  
- Using **Flexbox** for layout  
- Understanding the **Box Model**  

This project serves as hands-on practice to reinforce these concepts and improve front-end development skills.
